This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, create a ``` .env ``` file add API_TOKEN:

```bash
API_TOKEN={token}
```

 run the development server:

```bash
yarn
# and
yarn dev
```

run the tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Tech Stack

I have used Typescript NextJs Tailwindcss and react testing library.

I am using NextJS patterns such as error.js & layout.js to render a simple navbar and using the app router for pages.

I've not used any ui libraries just using tailwind to make some simple components and generated a theme using googles material theme.




## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
